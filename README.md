# pi-control-mains-switches
Python code that allows you to switch on and off radio controlled electrical mains sockets

Should work at least with the Elro & Brennenstuhl brands, and possibly others.

Tested with a Brennenstuhl RCS 1000, on channel (i.e. device) 1, device group (i.e. key) 1.


Based on
"elropi.py" for switching Elro devices using Python on Raspberry Pi
